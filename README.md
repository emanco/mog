## Getting Started

It's fairly simple to get the app up and running on your local development environment. Once you've cloned the repo, navigate to the root in your Terminal and run the following:

### `npm install`

This will check the package.json file and pull down any dependencies listed

Once that's completed run the following command:

### `npm start`

The application should now be accessible in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
There are no tests written at this point. This should be addressed.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
